TBCoin, True Boss Coin is a simply project to try concepts about blockchain
  
  ## Description 
  
  *The what, why, and how:* 
 What?
In this code I wrote basic concepts about how to create and maintain a cryptocurrency.
Implemented basic operating concepts such as creating and adding new chains, validations, hash generation and cryptocurrency proof of validity.

Why?
The blockchain concept, despite being widely used for use in cryptocurrencies, can also be used to meet other business requirements, so it is important to know at least the fundamentals of this technology and have a basic example on how to use it.

How
In this example, I implemented the basics using NodeJS and the crypto-js library.
We implemented a representation of each Block and a Manager of all Blocks, in addition to a process initializer.

 
  
  ## Requirements
  *Install NodeJS
  *Install crypto-js, npm install crypto-js
    
  ## Usage
